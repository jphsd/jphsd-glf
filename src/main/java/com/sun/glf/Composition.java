/**
 * Interface expected from objects able to perform rendering
 * on a drawing area. For example, this interface is used
 * by a <code>{@link com.sun.glf.CompositionComponent 
 * CompositionComponent}</code> to perform its rendering.
 * <br>
 * Note that <code>Compositions</code> can be used in contexts other than 
 * on-screen rendering such as off-screen image creation, in which case the 
 * <code>Composition</code> is used by 'clients' other than <code>CompositionComponent.
 * </code><br>
 * An example of <code>Composition</code> is the <code>LayerComposition</code>
 * which piles up <code>Layers</code> to produce a drawing.
 * <br>
 * Because there are situations where it is important to monitor the progress 
 * of a paint operation (e.g. to provide feedback to a user), the interface 
 * provides a way for interested parties to declare their interest in updates 
 * about the paint process. However, the 'quality' of the information feedback 
 * is left to the <code>Composition</code> implementations (i.e. how often, if 
 * ever, a <code>PaintProgressListener</code> is called is left to the implementation 
 * to decide).
